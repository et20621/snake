Based on the classic snake game, my parter [@mariastlouis](http://github.com/mariastlouis) and I kept the logic of the game but made it our own by adding a [Very Hungry Caterpillar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Very_Hungry_Caterpillar) theme. This project was created as part of the front-end curriculum at [The Turing School](http://turing.io). It served as our introduction to object-oriented programming. For example, each segment of the caterpillar is a Block object in an array. The food also extends the Block parent class. It was also the first time we ran our projects on a local server rather than just opening index.html. We had a lot of fun with this project!
